## TouchDesigner setup

- Download the zip file `TDWebRTC_TD-Standalone` in Resources.
- Open TouchDesigner file `WebRTC.toe`
- In Touchdesigner select `WebServer`
-   Pulse `Get Network Adapter`
-   Select desired Network Adapter from the dropdown parameter below
-   Toggle On `Web Server`
- This should give you a rendered view of the webpage in the `WebServer` comp to confirm it is working
- `Restart Web Server` pulse will reload the webserver and update URLs in other comps if you select a different network 
-   Toggle Off `Web Server` will kill the web server on port 5757

### 'WebRTC' Comp Configure
- To configure the `WebRTC` comp, select and go to `Config` tab
- After starting the web server the `My URL` will dynamically update
-   You can open the webpage of that URL by pulsing `Open Webpage`
- **Reset**
  - This resets all server and client signalling nodes
- **Flip Vertical** 
  - This swaps resolution width and height for portrait/vertical orientation
- Width and Heght
  - This is the pixel resolution
- **Flip Horizontal**
  - This mirrors the image. After testing fullscreen on both desktop and mobile, mobile devices tend to flip the image, while desktop browsers do not.
- **Port**
  - This sets the port for WebRTC. 
  - Note: WebRTC is a peer-to-peer protocol, which means each connection typically uses its own signaling port. To support multiple devices, youâ€™ll need to duplicate the `WebRTC` comp and assign a unique port to each instance.
- **Show QR Code URL**
  - This displays a dynamic QR Code in the comp that a mobile device can scan to go directly to the webpage and correct port
  - Everytime the port is updated the QR code will dynamically change 
  - Example: Changing to port `456` will generate a QR code that goes to `http://[yourIp]/?port=456`, once you scan it with your phone it will automatically connect on that port
- **Show Port**
  - This displays the port number in the video feed for easy debugging
